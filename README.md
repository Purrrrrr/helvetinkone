This thing might be a bit hard to understand if you're not fluent in Finnish.
Instructions: open sampo.html and enter any six character code with the characters 1 to 9 or A with no repeating characters. Enjoy the madness.

You can also try to run it from [github.io](http://purrrrrr.github.io/helvetinkone/sampo.html "Demo") 
or play around with the [test tool](http://purrrrrr.github.io/helvetinkone/sampo-test.html).
